## `aq update` command
```
zigmod aq update
```

This command takes zero arguments and updates all programs installed with [`zigmod aq install`](./aq_install.md).

Adding `~/.zigmod/bin` to your `$PATH` will allow you to reference the commands by name instead of by absolute path.

The directory `~/.cache/zigmod` is a cache directory and may be deleted at any time.
